Due to a lack of teeth X-ray datasets online, the team started to create a graphical dataset simulation for the teeth dataset to be used for initial testing. The generated multiview dataset is available here:

The dataset contains the following (Figure 2):

    Thirty-two folders (each folder is named after the corresponding tooth iso name) contain 18 images of different views generated by Unity 3D c# scripts
    Ground truth OBJ 3D format [73]: 3D format for each tooth as Mesh OBJ files. contains 32 models.
    Ground truth Binvox 3D format [74]: 3D voxel format for each tooth. It contains 32 models.
